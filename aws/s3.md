3rd Party User Access
---------------------

### General Setup
- create a bucket for third party access
  - we're going to give users access to their own sub-folders therein
- create a policy that gives 3rd party users access to their specific user folder in a 3rd party bucket
  - inspiration: http://blogs.aws.amazon.com/security/post/Tx1P2T3LFXXCNB5/Writing-IAM-policies-Grant-access-to-user-specific-folders-in-an-Amazon-S3-bucke
  - see my final policy below

```

        {

                    "s3:prefix": [
                        ""
                    ],
                    "s3:delimiter": [
                        "/"
                    ]
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowListingOfUserFolder",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::3rd-party-storage"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "StringLike": {
                    "s3:prefix": [
                        "${aws:username}/*"
                    ]
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowAllS3ActionsInUserFolder",
            "Action": [
                "s3:*"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::3rd-party-storage/${aws:username}/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

- create a 3rd party user group and attach the 3rd party access policy
- create a user and put them in the 3rd party group
  - create access key id and secret key (gives the user programatic access)  
  - create a user/pass (required only for aws console access)
- create a subfolder that is the user's name in the 3rd party bucket
  - eg. if the username is `jones`, then the sub-folder should be `bucket/jones/`

### Secutiry Notes
- this setup allows users to see all your buckets (although they can't access them)
  - this is required to allow them to traverse the folder structure
  - this is ONLY required if the users need access via the aws console, or other folder based gui
  - this is NOT required if users will only access thier "folder" directly, programatically
  - the policy below is not tested, but should only allow access to their exact folder

    "Version": "2012-10-17",

        {
            "Sid": "AllowListingOfUserFolder",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::3rd-party-storage"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "StringLike": {
                    "s3:prefix": [
                        "${aws:username}/*"
                    ]
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowAllS3ActionsInUserFolder",
            "Action": [
                "s3:*"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::3rd-party-storage/${aws:username}/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Creating new users
- create a user and put them in the 3rd party group
  - create access key id and secret key (gives the user programatic access)  
  - create a user/pass (required only for aws console access)
- create a subfolder that is the user's name in the 3rd party bucket
  - eg. if the username is `jones`, then the sub-folder should be `bucket/jones/`

### How do Users access thier bucket/folder?
