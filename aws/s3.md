3rd Party User Access
---------------------

### General Setup
- create a bucket for third party access
  - we're going to give users access to their own sub-folders therein
- create a policy that gives 3rd party users access to their specific user folder in a 3rd party bucket
  - inspiration: http://blogs.aws.amazon.com/security/post/Tx1P2T3LFXXCNB5/Writing-IAM-policies-Grant-access-to-user-specific-folders-in-an-Amazon-S3-bucke
  - see my final policy below

}
```

- create a 3rd party user group and attach the 3rd party access policy
- create a user and put them in the 3rd party group
  - create access key id and secret key (gives the user programatic access)  
  - create a user/pass (required only for aws console access)
- create a subfolder that is the user's name in the 3rd party bucket
  - eg. if the username is `jones`, then the sub-folder should be `bucket/jones/`

### Creating new users
- create a user and put them in the 3rd party group
  - create access key id and secret key (gives the user programatic access)  
  - create a user/pass (required only for aws console access)
- create a subfolder that is the user's name in the 3rd party bucket
  - eg. if the username is `jones`, then the sub-folder should be `bucket/jones/`

### How do Users access thier bucket/folder?
